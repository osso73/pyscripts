# Change log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on Keep a Changelog. For the version numbers, I just use a simple 2-digit, for major and minor changes. Each version has its corresponding apk under the folder releases.


## Pending changes to implement in the future

- Add options for Zoom in / Zoom out
- add button to clear screen. Not sure if I should clear screen every time I start a script...
- Tabs should be limited to parameters. All scripts share the output QTextEdit, and the button to execute (and help button). Maybe this could be implemented through invisible tabs?
- Split code into classes, one class per script


## v1.0 - ??

Initial version.
